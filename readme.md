## Abstract
This program helps to construct 3D recognition algorithms for the bin picking based on the 3D pointcloud.

The project takes a .STL mesh model as an input, then it will create a synthetic scene using [Point Cloud Library(PCL)](http://pointclouds.org/) for pointcloud processing and [Bullet Physics](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/) for physics simulation.
